# NEDC_Style_Checker

This is a Python script that I have modified from [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) for NEDC(Neural Engineer Data Consortium).
I have modified the script to use NEDC's internal tool which check many headers that are specific to NEDC's guideline and certain PEP-8 standards.
